# Contributing to Here2There

Thank you for contributing to our project. We use a basic git workflow, with a few specific guidelines.

## Guidelines

- Branch names should be prefixed with the branch type, e.g. bug, feature, refactor, or style. The format of a branch name should be `branch-type_branch-name`.
- Commit messages should follow the [Conventional Commits guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#summary).
- Working branches should branch off of the `develop` branch and be merged back to the `develop` branch.

## Workflow

1. Fork the project
2. Create a working branch (e.g. `git checkout -b feature/great-feature`)
3. Commit changes (e.g. `git commit -m 'feat: add a great feature'`)
4. Push the working branch to the remote (`git push origin feature/great-feature`)
5. Open a pull request
